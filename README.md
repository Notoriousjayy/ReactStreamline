# ReactStreamline

ReactStreamline is a minimal React application built with TypeScript. It is designed to demonstrate containerization using Docker and includes a CI/CD pipeline setup with GitHub Actions for seamless development and deployment workflows.

---

## Features
- **React** with **TypeScript** for robust and type-safe development.
- **Dockerized** for containerized deployment.
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD to automate build, test, and deployment.
- Clean, minimal setup ready for expansion.

---

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for containerization)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ReactStreamline.git
cd ReactStreamline
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server
